# SquaTz
## A power perpetuals derivative platform

SquaTz is a Tezos-based Power Perpetual that provides traders with perpetual exposure to XTZ². This is a valuable primitive for market participants who want to be long gamma, hedge short gamma exposure or get 2x leverage without having to worry about liquidation. SquaTz works in a similar way to a perpetual swap, except instead of XTZ, it tracks the index of XTZ².
Long SquaTz (XTZ²) allows you to take a leveraged position with limitless upside potential, little downside risk, and no liquidations. Similar to convexity, you profit more when XTZ goes up and lose less when XTZ² goes down when compared to a 2x leveraged position. For example, if XTZ increases by 5 times, SquaTz increases by 25 times. For this position, you pay a funding rate. We have also created Strategies as an easy way to participate in a pool that conducts some common trading flows for short and long SquaTz: minting and burning SquaTz to generate yield and changing the collateral position to manage risk.
